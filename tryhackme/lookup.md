OmniHTTPD is a webserver for Microsoft Windows operating systems. OmniHTTPD supports a number of CGI extensions which provide dynamic content.

A HTML injection vulnerability has been reported in the '/cgi-bin/redir.exe' sample CGI included with OmniHTTPD. Reportedly, it is possible for an attacker to URL encode the newline character (%0D) and insert malicious HTML code. A vulnerable server receiving a malformed request will return a 302 redirect HTTP response containing the malicious attacker-supplied code.
